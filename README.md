# AI Virtual Keyboard

The AI Virtual Keyboard is a Python-based project that implements a virtual keyboard system using OpenCV for hand tracking. This virtual keyboard allows users to type without a physical keyboard, making it particularly useful for touchless and gesture-based interaction.

## Description

The virtual keyboard is designed to recognize hand gestures and translate them into keypresses. It utilizes computer vision techniques to detect hand movements and associate them with specific keys on a virtual keyboard. The system can be used for various applications, including touchless typing, controlling smart devices, and more.

## Features

- **Hand Tracking**: Utilizes OpenCV for real-time hand tracking and landmark detection.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Recognizes hand gestures and maps them to keys on the virtual keyboard.
- **Customizable Keyboard Layout**: The keyboard layout can be easily customized to suit your preferences.
- **Live Output Viewer**: Includes a live output viewer for monitoring and displaying typed content.

## Requirements

To run the AI Virtual Keyboard, you will need:

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- cvzone (HandTrackingModule)
- Tkinter (for the live output viewer)

## Installation

- Clone the repository
